# Time-Trials-Code
Time Trials (Temp) is a stealth puzzle game we are developping, where you complete puzzles through a time travel gimmick, where you warp back in time into the same level. But here's the catch: **You're not allowed to cause any time paradoxes**. 

This is the source code for the project. The project is developped with Unity 2019.
